Multiple Courses and practices including various exercises and projects which i took and completed to help you building and improving your knowledge and skill in AI and Machine learning.<br>
There is also my approach besides the answer in each session.<br> 
## Data Science
- 1 Python Crash Course
   * working with the Windows terminal environment (cd, cd .., dir, cls, jupyter notebook)<br>
   * 2 Different data types (Numbers (int, float), Lists, Strings, Sets, Tuples, Dictionaries, Booleans)<br>
   * Definition of variables (Variables)<br>
   * Display data and print (Regular Printing, .format printing)<br>
   * comparison and logical operators (Comparison Operators, logic Operators (and, or, not))<br>
   * conditional statements (if, elif, else statements)<br>
   * loops (for, while)<br>
   * Summarizing lists (list comprehensions)<br>
   * range function<br>
   * Interrupt in case of getting stuck in the loop<br>
   * Functions and function output (functions, return)<br>
   * disposable functions (lambda)<br>
   * mapping functions (map, filter)<br>
   * single-line and multi-line comments (#, """ """)<br>
   * Applied methods for different types of data (Methods)<br>
   * (lower, upper, split | keys, values ​​| append, pop, remove, in | add)<br>
   * Indexing, slicing and step jumping (indexing, slicing, step)<br>
- 2  Numpy
   * Numpy Arrays<br>
   * Types of array creation methods (np.array,np.arange,np.ones,np.zeros,np.linspace,np.eye,np.random(rand,randn,randint))<br>
   * methods and features (reshape, min, max, argmax, argmin, flatten, vstack, hstack, concatenate, shape, dtype)<br>
   * Indexing and Slicing (Bracket Indexing, Slicing)<br>
   * Broadcasting<br>
   * Arrays are pointers and the copy solution<br>
   * Indexing in matrices ([row_start:row_end,Column_Start:Column_end])<br>
   * Selecting a few special rows and columns (Fancy Indexing)<br>
   * range function<br>
   * Writing query and separating part from the array based on a condition (Selection)<br>
   * Operations in arrays (calculation operations and mathematical functions)<br>

### Note : there is three files in each directory:
- Session : covers the content of that session in code.
- Practice : the Practice to review and learn the stuff you being taught in the session.
- Answer : My answer to the Practice.
- Solution : True Answer of the Practice file.
